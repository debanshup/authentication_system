## Getting Started

## Email Functionality

---

This project uses the [SMTP_SERVER](https://github.com/debanshup/SMTP_SERVER) to send emails. The email functionality has been implemented in the `src/helper/mailer.ts`.

For more details about the SMTP server, refer to the official repository: [SMTP_SERVER on GitHub](https://github.com/debanshup/SMTP_SERVER).

Alternatively, you can implement your own email sender if preferred.

---

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
